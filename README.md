## Development

### Step 1 (Required in mobile platform)
> [TIP]
>
> This project depends Firebase. Please first run
> ```bash
> flutterfire configure
> ```
> 
> and configuring file `/android/app/google-services.json`, `/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (two file auto create by `flutterfire`)

- `/android/app/google-services.json` required for Android
- `/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` required for iOS

> [TIP]
> 
> **NOTE** (If you development for iOS)
>
> Please edit `CFBundleURLSchemes` in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

### Step 2 (Required in desktop platform)
Goto https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials and get `Client ID` and `Client secret` from `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs` (Use `Web application`)

Set to `.env`
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret>
```

## Firebase Configuration

The `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files required for Firebase integration will be automatically generated by `flutterfire`. You do not need to manually create or download these files.

To set up Firebase for your project, follow these steps:

1. Run the `flutterfire` CLI tool:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

2. Select your Firebase project or create a new one.

3. The tool will automatically generate the necessary configuration files and place them in the appropriate directories.

4. Once the setup is complete, you can build and run your app with Firebase integration.

For more details, refer to the [FlutterFire documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/).

## GitHub Actions

To release the application, the following `secrets` must be provided:

### **For Android**
- `KEYSTORE_CONTENT` - Base64-encoded content of the `keystore.jks` file.
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - Password used to sign the `keystore.jks` file.
- `KEYSTORE_ALIAS` - Alias used to sign the `keystore.jks` file.
- `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` - Base64-encoded content of the `google-services.json` file (automatically generated by `flutterfire`).

### **For iOS**
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST` - Base64-encoded content of the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file (automatically generated by `flutterfire`).

> **Note**: The `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files are automatically created when you run the `flutterfire configure` command during Firebase setup.
